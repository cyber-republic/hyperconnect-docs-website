Enabling connectivity for devices allows remote monitoring and control over consumer, commercial and industrial hardware. Peer-to-Peer Network \u00b6 A Peer-to-Peer network is completely decentralized system of interconnected nodes in which all participants are considered equal, meaning no central authority has control over the network. Decentralized Identity \u00b6 The idea of decentralized identification is that a unique ID may be requested from a decentralized identity provider instead of a centralized identity provider. The decentralized ID, also called DID, allows proof of identity and ownership of a digital asset through cryptographically secure public and private keys. Carrier \u00b6 The Carrier is the endpoint, also called node, of a peer-to-peer network. The Carrier connects to the P2P network by identifying itself first, routes encrypted messages in the network and handles encryption and decryption of own messages. Private and Public Keys \u00b6 Private and Public Keys are used in asymmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data for secure data transfer and ownership. The public key may be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept private, as the combination of the private and public key together allows access to the protected data or asset. End-to-End Encryption \u00b6 End-to-End encryption is process of encrypting the data by the sender before sending, then transmitting the data as encrypted, and finally decrypting the data by the receiver to prevent data from being read or modified during the transfer. Blockchain \u00b6 Blockchain is distributed ledger of transactions, storing information about the sender, receiver, amount that was sent and information relevant to the block itself in which it was stored in the entire chain of blocks that are publicly available. Each participant in the blockchain network has an own copy of the blockchain which is constantly updated across the entire network to prevent manipulation of transactions or the history of transactions.","title":"General Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/general-concepts/#general-concepts","text":"","title":"General Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/general-concepts/#internet-of-things","text":"The Internet-of-Things, also called IoT, describes the idea of connected physical devices via the internet.

What are present issues with the Internet of Things? \u00b6 Data \u00b6 Large amounts of generated data - IoT devices generate large amounts of data, which must be processed to create valuable information to its users. Performance \u00b6 Performance vs. cost - Data processing can rarely be done locally due to low performance of the device. An increase in hardware performance locally would increase costs, which takes away the competitive edge of the Internet-of-Things. Communication \u00b6 Communication is vital - As a result, there is a necessity of data transfer to remote nodes as well as the possibility for bidirectional communication. Security \u00b6 Secure communication requires known identities - Although there are many widely accepted technologies available on the market for secure data transfer, they all rely on the assumption that both parties involved are known to each other and can prove their identities. Secure communication only hides the data that is transferred, but leaves the participant\u2019s identities discoverable. Identities \u00b6 Known identities pose a threat to privacy - The possibility of linking identities is the biggest threat to privacy, and the Internet-of-Things is strongly affected by this issue. Identities are much more valuable than the data exchanged between them. Privacy \u00b6 Lack of privacy - The Internet-of-Things needs a solution to allow neighbor discovery for bidirectional communication, but without the need for participant identities that can be linked to real world identities.","title":"Goals"},{"location":"get-started/goals/#goals","text":"","title":"Goals"},{"location":"get-started/goals/#what-are-the-goals-of-the-project","text":"Low to no cost for communication Low cost for validation Low latency Cross-communication Secure communication Anonymity Cross-platform endpoints Ability to store data locally or in a distributed manner Ability to analyze data locally or globally Maintain an overview while having the same role as any other participant in the network Easy to understand, intuitive user interface Allow local integration of any service Modularity for easy development Incentive to join the network and create a sharing economy Allow exchange of value Remove middlemen The purpose of the HyperConnect project is to satisfy all the above needs with an open source, powerful and secure solution for private, commercial and enterprise use.","title":"What are the goals of the project?"},{"location":"get-started/goals/#what-are-present-issues-with-the-internet-of-things","text":"","title":"What are present issues with the Internet of Things?"},{"location":"get-started/goals/#data","text":"Large amounts of generated data - IoT devices generate large amounts of data, which must be processed to create valuable information to its users.","title":"Data"},{"location":"get-started/goals/#performance","text":"Performance vs. cost - Data processing can rarely be done locally due to low performance of the device.

Remote Controller \u00b6 The Remote Controller is the software component that runs on the mobile phone or computer of a user and allows the monitoring and remote control of the connected edge clients via a graphical user interface. Devices \u00b6 Devices are the hardware to which the sensors are connected. By running IoT relevant software on the devices , such as the Edge Client, devices also serve as the gateway to remote systems and allow the exchange of data. Sensors \u00b6 Sensors allow the measurement of physical properties and translate these into electric signals that can then be processed by a device. Sensor Groups \u00b6 Sensor Groups allow the flexible collection of sensors by their parameters, locations, properties for simple management by the user. For example, a SenseHat Board for the Raspberry Pi has multiple sensors that are all located on a single board. These sensors (sensor attributes) may all be grouped together. Sensor Attributes \u00b6 Each sensor can only measure one certain physical property, therefore to each sensor, one attribute may be defined. Sensor Scripts \u00b6 Bare hardware sensors, require special programs (scripts) to translate the electrical impulses into meaningful data. To each sensor, a sensor script may be defined. Rules \u00b6 Rules are the user defined custom logic that defines how and when the system should react changes in the environment, based on the collected data. Data is constantly analyzed by the rules engine to check if any of the rules have been fulfilled. Actions \u00b6 Actions are the responses to changes in the environment, predefined by rules. The fulfilment of a rule and an action are considered an event. Events \u00b6 Events are considered the process of fulfilment of certain predefined rules. If a rule with a certain logic is fulfilled, an action is carried out automatically by the rules engine. For example, by predefining a rule such as that if the measured temperature by the sensor 'temp' reaches 30 degrees Celsius, turn on the LED light. An event is considered the fulfilment of the rule 'above 30 degrees' and the action to turn on the LED light.","title":"IoT Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#internet-of-things-concepts","text":"","title":"Internet-of-Things Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#edge-client","text":"The Edge Client is the software component that runs on the IoT device and can be used with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or via Command Line (Terminal).","title":"Edge Client"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#remote-controller","text":"The Remote Controller is the software component that runs on the mobile phone or computer of a user and allows the monitoring and remote control of the connected edge clients via a graphical user interface.","title":"Remote Controller"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#devices","text":"Devices are the hardware to which the sensors are connected.
