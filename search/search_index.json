Enabling connectivity for devices allows remote monitoring and control over consumer, commercial and industrial hardware. Peer-to-Peer Network \u00b6 A Peer-to-Peer network is completely decentralized system of interconnected nodes in which all participants are considered equal, meaning no central authority has control over the network. Decentralized Identity \u00b6 The idea of decentralized identification is that a unique ID may be requested from a decentralized identity provider instead of a centralized identity provider. The decentralized ID, also called DID, allows proof of identity and ownership of a digital asset through cryptographically secure public and private keys. Carrier \u00b6 The Carrier is the endpoint, also called node, of a peer-to-peer network. The Carrier connects to the P2P network by identifying itself first, routes encrypted messages in the network and handles encryption and decryption of own messages. Private and Public Keys \u00b6 Private and Public Keys are used in asymmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data for secure data transfer and ownership. The public key may be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept private, as the combination of the private and public key together allows access to the protected data or asset. End-to-End Encryption \u00b6 End-to-End encryption is process of encrypting the data by the sender before sending, then transmitting the data as encrypted, and finally decrypting the data by the receiver to prevent data from being read or modified during the transfer. Blockchain \u00b6 Blockchain is distributed ledger of transactions, storing information about the sender, receiver, amount that was sent and information relevant to the block itself in which it was stored in the entire chain of blocks that are publicly available. Each participant in the blockchain network has an own copy of the blockchain which is constantly updated across the entire network to prevent manipulation of transactions or the history of transactions.","title":"General Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/general-concepts/#general-concepts","text":"","title":"General Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/general-concepts/#internet-of-things","text":"The Internet-of-Things, also called IoT, describes the idea of connected physical devices via the internet.

Remote Controller \u00b6 The Remote Controller is the software component that runs on the mobile phone or computer of a user and allows the monitoring and remote control of the connected edge clients via a graphical user interface. Devices \u00b6 Devices are the hardware to which the sensors are connected. By running IoT relevant software on the devices , such as the Edge Client, devices also serve as the gateway to remote systems and allow the exchange of data. Sensors \u00b6 Sensors allow the measurement of physical properties and translate these into electric signals that can then be processed by a device. Sensor Groups \u00b6 Sensor Groups allow the flexible collection of sensors by their parameters, locations, properties for simple management by the user. For example, a SenseHat Board for the Raspberry Pi has multiple sensors that are all located on a single board. These sensors (sensor attributes) may all be grouped together. Sensor Attributes \u00b6 Each sensor can only measure one certain physical property, therefore to each sensor, one attribute may be defined. Sensor Scripts \u00b6 Bare hardware sensors, require special programs (scripts) to translate the electrical impulses into meaningful data. To each sensor, a sensor script may be defined. Rules \u00b6 Rules are the user defined custom logic that defines how and when the system should react changes in the environment, based on the collected data. Data is constantly analyzed by the rules engine to check if any of the rules have been fulfilled. Actions \u00b6 Actions are the responses to changes in the environment, predefined by rules. The fulfilment of a rule and an action are considered an event. Events \u00b6 Events are considered the process of fulfilment of certain predefined rules. If a rule with a certain logic is fulfilled, an action is carried out automatically by the rules engine. For example, by predefining a rule such as that if the measured temperature by the sensor 'temp' reaches 30 degrees Celsius, turn on the LED light. An event is considered the fulfilment of the rule 'above 30 degrees' and the action to turn on the LED light.","title":"IoT Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#internet-of-things-concepts","text":"","title":"Internet-of-Things Concepts"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#edge-client","text":"The Edge Client is the software component that runs on the IoT device and can be used with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or via Command Line (Terminal).","title":"Edge Client"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#remote-controller","text":"The Remote Controller is the software component that runs on the mobile phone or computer of a user and allows the monitoring and remote control of the connected edge clients via a graphical user interface.","title":"Remote Controller"},{"location":"get-started/iot-concepts/#devices","text":"Devices are the hardware to which the sensors are connected.

The following situation should be handled: If the value from the Input Attribute is above a certain temperature, set the Output Attribute to 'H'. If the value from the Input Attribute is below a certain temperature, set the Output Attribute to 'C'. Great, let's get started! Open the 'Sensors' view. \u00b6 Enter the name 'Raspi' and type 'Raspberry Pi'. Click 'Add' to create the new Sensor Group. \u00b6 The new Sensor Group 'Raspi' is added to the Sensor List. Click 'Configure' to add new Sensor Attributes. \u00b6 By clicking 'Configure', the List of defined attributes appears as well as the 'Add Attribute' section. \u00b6 Create a new attribute: \u00b6 Name: temp Type: double Direction: Input (from sensor to device) Interval: 5 sec Click 'Add' to save the new attribute. \u00b6 In the Sensor Attribute List, click the '< >'(Script) button. \u00b6 Click the 'Edit' button to enable editing. \u00b6 Add the following script: \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from sense_hat import SenseHat sense = SenseHat() sense.clear() temp = sense.get_temperature() print(temp) Click 'Validate'. The Python compiler will check if everything is correct. \u00b6 Click 'Save'. Then click 'Back to Attribute List'. \u00b6 After click 'Back to Attribute List', the overview list will be shown. \u00b6 In the 'Add Attribute' section on top, add a new Attribute: \u00b6 Name: led Type: string Direction: output(device to sensor) Interval: Event-driven Click 'Add'. \u00b6 The 'led' attribute has been added successfully. \u00b6 Click the '< >'(Script) button of the 'led' attribute. \u00b6 Click 'Edit' to enable editing. \u00b6 Editing has been enabled if the 'Validate' button is visible. \u00b6 Add the following script to the body: \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 import sys parameter=sys.argv[1] from sense_hat import SenseHat sense=SenseHat() sense.show_letter(parameter, text_colour=[255,0,0]) print(\"DONE\") Enter the Input Parameter: H \u00b6 Click 'Validate'. \u00b6 On the Raspberry Pi SenseHAT, the letter H will be shown on the LED matrix. This is for validation only. \u00b6 Save the changes and return to the Attribute List. \u00b6 Activate both Attributes by clicking the switch in their rows. \u00b6 Let's check the read values of the input attribute. \u00b6 Click 'Sensors' in the menu. \u00b6 Click the 'Overview' button. \u00b6 The Latest Value read was around 35.77 . \u00b6 Click the 'Refresh' in the top right corner. The Latest Value read was around 35.74 . We will use this data to configure our events. \u00b6 In the Menu, click 'Events'. Then click 'Add Event'. \u00b6 Events consist of an Event Source and an Event Action. \u00b6 Event Sources are the values from Input Attributes. Event Actions are commands sent to the Output Attributes. Select the following values: \u00b6 Event Source \u00b6 Sensor: Raspi (Raspberry Pi) Attribute: temp (double) Attribute Average: Real-Time Event Condition: greater than Event Value: 37.5 (or similar, depending on the average temp on your device) Event Action \u00b6 Sensor: Raspi (Raspberry Pi) Attribute: led (string) Trigger Value: H (for Hot) Event Name \u00b6 Name: TempHot (or anything memorable) Click 'Add' to save and return to overview. \u00b6 In the overview section, let's add a second event, in case the temp goes below 37.5 , how should the output value be set. \u00b6 Click 'Add Event'. \u00b6 Let's configure the new event. \u00b6 Select the following values: \u00b6 Event Source \u00b6 Sensor: Raspi (Raspberry Pi) Attribute: temp (double) Attribute Average: Real-Time Event Condition: less than Event Value: 37.5 (or similar, depending on the average temp on your device) Event Action \u00b6 Sensor: Raspi (Raspberry Pi) Attribute: led (string) Trigger Value: C (for Cold) Event Name \u00b6 Name: TempCold (or anything memorable) Click 'Add' to save the new event and return to the overview. \u00b6 Great! \u00b6 Let's activate both events by clicking the switches. \u00b6 In case the temperature is above the defined 37.5 degrees, the Raspberry Pi will display the letter 'H'. \u00b6 By blowing over the temperature sensor and lowering the temperature of the board, the Raspberry Pi will monitor the changes and will change the letter 'H' to the letter 'C'. \u00b6 Connect a Remote Controller \u00b6 Note: To install a Remote Controller on a mobile phone, please follow the instructions here: \u00b6 Remote Controller installation on Android Note: To connect the Remote Controller with the Edge Client, please follow the instruction: \u00b6 Connect new Remote Controller On the Edge Client, make sure the connection is 'Active'. \u00b6 On the Remote Controller, make sure the device is 'Online'. \u00b6 On the Remote Controller, click the 'Sensors' button. \u00b6 The sensor data from the Edge Client will be automatically displayed on the sensor overview. \u00b6 On the Remote Controller, click the 'History' button to see the graph of readings. \u00b6 The graph of readings will be displayed and updates automatically. \u00b6 Excellent!

The Output Sensor Attribute will have the purpose of writing a value into a local .txt file. These values provided to the Output Sensor Attribute will be by rules that are defined in so called 'Events'. The following situation should be handled: If the value from the Input Attribute is above 5, set the Output Attribute to 'True'. (It will write the value 'True' into the .txt file) If the value from the Input Attribute is below 5, set the Output Attribute to 'False'. (It will write the value 'True' into the .txt file) Great, let's get started! Open the 'Sensors' view. \u00b6 Add a new Sensor with the name 'RandomValue' and Type 'Random' or similar. \u00b6 Click 'Add' to save the new Sensor Group. \u00b6 Click 'Configure'. \u00b6 No attributes have been configured yet. \u00b6 Create a new Attribute. Fill in the values: \u00b6 Name: rand Type: integer Direction: input (from sensor to device) Interval: 5 sec The attribute has been created successfully. \u00b6 Click the '< >' button to configure the Sensor Attribute Script. \u00b6 To start editing, click the 'Edit' button. \u00b6 Edit mode will appear and the script may be added manually or from a template. \u00b6 Select the template 'randomGenerator (Test)'. \u00b6 The script will be added to the script body. \u00b6 Click 'Validate' to validate the script. \u00b6 After successful validation, click 'Save' to save the changes. Then click 'Back to Attribute List'. \u00b6 In the overview, the Script State will now show as 'valid'. \u00b6 Toggle the button in the Action area to activate the Sensor Attribute. \u00b6 The collection of data will start at this point. \u00b6 The Attribute State has now changed to active. \u00b6 In the 'Add Attribute' section, create a new Attribute with the following details: \u00b6 Name: resultToText Type: boolean Direction: output (from device to sensor) Interval: Event-driven (cannot be changed for output direction) Click the 'Add' to save the new attribute. \u00b6 In the overview, click the '< >'(Script) button. \u00b6 In the bottom left corner, click 'Edit' to enable editing of the script. \u00b6 The script can now be edited, as the 'Validate' button has appeared. \u00b6 Enter the following detail: \u00b6 Input Parameter: True From the 'Templates' dropdown in the top-right corner, select the 'writeToFile (Test)' template. \u00b6 Click the 'Validate' button. \u00b6 Save the changes by clicking the 'Save' button and then click 'Back to Attribute List' to return to the overview. \u00b6 The script state for the attribute 'resultToText' is now valid. \u00b6 Click on the switch to activate the 'resultToText' attribute. \u00b6 Great, both Attributes are now valid and active! \u00b6 In the Menu, click 'Events'. \u00b6 Then, click the 'Add Events' button. \u00b6 For this scenario, we will need to eventually create two events. The first Event will handle the situation if the random generated number by the input Attribute is above 5, then save the value 'true' to the test.txt file. \u00b6 Let's fill out the details for the first event scenario as follows: \u00b6 Event Source \u00b6 Sensor: RandomValue (Random) Attribute: rand (integer) Attribute Average: Real-Time Event Condition: greater than Event Value: 5 Event Action \u00b6 Sensor: RandomValue (Random) Attribute: resultToText Event Trigger Value: True Event Parameters \u00b6 Name: greaterThan5 Finally, click the 'Add' button to save the event. \u00b6 In the Event List overview, click 'Add Event' to create the second event. \u00b6 This second will handle the situation if the random generated number by the input Attribute is below 5, then save the value 'false' to the test.txt file. \u00b6 Let's fill out the details for the first event scenario as follows: \u00b6 Event Source \u00b6 Sensor: RandomValue (Random) Attribute: rand (integer) Attribute Average: Real-Time Event Condition: less than Event Value: 5 Event Action \u00b6 Sensor: RandomValue (Random) Attribute: resultToText Event Trigger Value: False Event Parameters \u00b6 Name: lessThan5 Finally, click the 'Add' button to save the event. \u00b6 Both Events are now created and will be listed in the overview. \u00b6 Activate both Events by clicking on the switches. \u00b6 Now that the Events are active, the Edge Client will start writing the results of the evaluations from the Input Attribute to the Output Attribute. In this case, if the value from the input attribute is greater than 5, write the value 'True' in the test.txt file, if it is below 5, overwrite the value with the value 'False'. \u00b6 Let us check the current value of the Input Attribute. \u00b6 Click 'Sensors' in the Menu, then for the input Attribute, click the 'Overview' button. The Input Attribute will be shown with its latest value. \u00b6 Use the refresh button in the top-right corner to check the latest value. \u00b6 Remember, the value is always updated after every 5 seconds. \u00b6 In File Explorer on Windows, navigate to the folder with the downloaded files for HyperConnect and locate the 'test.txt' file. \u00b6 Open 'test.txt' in Notepad or similar program. \u00b6 Because the read value was 2, which is less than 5, the second event was fulfilled successfully and the value 'false' was written in the test.txt file. \u00b6 Back to the overview, click the 'Refresh' button in the top-right corner to see the new value read from the input attribute. \u00b6 The value was 6, so the first event must have been fulfilled. \u00b6 Correctly, if you re-open the test.txt file, the value was set to 'true'. \u00b6 Connect a Remote Controller \u00b6 Note: To install a Remote Controller on a mobile phone, please follow the instructions here: \u00b6 Remote Controller installation on Android Note: To connect the Remote Controller with the Edge Client, please follow the instruction: \u00b6 Connect new Remote Controller On the Edge Client, make sure the connection is 'Active'. \u00b6 On the Remote Controller, make sure the device is 'Online'. \u00b6 On the Remote Controller, click the 'Sensors' button. \u00b6 The sensor data from the Edge Client will be automatically displayed on the sensor overview. \u00b6 On the Remote Controller, click the 'History' button to see the graph of readings. \u00b6 The graph of readings will be displayed and updates automatically. \u00b6 Awesome, you did it! This is a good example of how data input streams can be monitored automatically and that the rules can be predefined for any outcome. \u00b6 Did you notice the that Input Attribute when it was exactly 5 was not handled in this tutorial? \u00b6 Give it a try and create a third event which sets the boolean value 'true' when the Input Attribute is 'equal to' 5. \u00b6 Note: 'greater than or equal' and 'less than or equal' options are not available by default to avoid any overlapping in the Rules Engine. Good luck and feel free to ask in the Forum if you face any issues! \u00b6","title":"Generated Random Numbers Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorials/windows-desktop-dev/generated-numbers-local-events-tutorial/#generated-random-values-on-windows-and-local-events","text":"In this tutorial an Input Sensor Attribute will be created, which instead of reading from an actual Sensor, will generate its own random value between 0 and 9.
