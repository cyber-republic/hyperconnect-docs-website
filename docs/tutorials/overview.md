Tutorials are a great way to get familiar with the tools that help you build your own peer-to-peer Internet-of-Things network.

Before jumping into tutorials, it is recommended to understand the [General Concepts](https://docs.hyperconnect.io/get-started/general-concepts/) as well as the [IoT Concepts](https://docs.hyperconnect.io/get-started/iot-concepts/).

Also, while testing on Windows, Ubuntu or MacOS desktop PCs is possible, the HyperConnect framework is designed for IoT devices such as the Raspberry Pi.
