# Goals

## What are the goals of the project?
- Low to no cost for communication
- Low cost for validation
- Low latency
- Cross-communication
- Secure communication
- Anonymity
- Cross-platform endpoints
- Ability to store data locally or in a distributed manner
- Ability to analyze data locally or globally
- Maintain an overview while having the same role as any other participant in the network
- Easy to understand, intuitive user interface
- Allow local integration of any service
- Modularity for easy development
- Incentive to join the network and create a sharing economy
- Allow exchange of value
- Remove middlemen

The purpose of the HyperConnect project is to satisfy all the above needs with an open source, powerful and secure solution for private, commercial and enterprise use.

## What are present issues with the Internet of Things?

### Data
Large amounts of generated data -
IoT devices generate large amounts of data, which must be processed to create valuable information to its users.

### Performance
Performance vs. cost -
Data processing can rarely be done locally due to low performance of the device. An increase in hardware performance locally would increase costs, which takes away the competitive edge of the Internet-of-Things.

### Communication
Communication is vital -
As a result, there is a necessity of data transfer to remote nodes as well as the possibility for bidirectional communication.

### Security
Secure communication requires known identities -
Although there are many widely accepted technologies available on the market for secure data transfer, they all rely on the assumption that both parties involved are known to each other and can prove their identities. Secure communication only hides the data that is transferred, but leaves the participantâ€™s identities discoverable.

### Identities
Known identities pose a threat to privacy -
The possibility of linking identities is the biggest threat to privacy, and the Internet-of-Things is strongly affected by this issue. Identities are much more valuable than the data exchanged between them.

### Privacy
Lack of privacy -
The Internet-of-Things needs a solution to allow neighbor discovery for bidirectional communication, but without the need for participant identities that can be linked to real world identities.
